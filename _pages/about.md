I'm a first year phd student from [School of CS](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning. 

I received my B.Sc. degree in [Honor College](https://honors.nwpu.edu.cn/xygk/xyjj.htm) from [NorthWestern Politechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/) in June 2025. In the same year, I was admitted to study for a Ph.D. degree without entrance examination. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yang](http://www.se.sjtu.edu.cn/Data/View/307) of DaLab.
